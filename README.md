## This is about-me page

Sorry guys I don't have open source projects currently, always worked for money :)

Nevertheless, you can try some of my pet projects:

1. [Limbotarget](http://limbotarget.ru) - a system which parses users from Russian most popular social web [VK](http://vk.com) in many different ways. It is used by smm managers to get a target audience from VK. Using these sets they can place more efficient and cheap advertisments in VK.

2. [@GotWordBot](https://telegram.me/GotWordBot) - a multi-lingual [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot which helps your to learn new words from foreign language in a more effective manner. It is based on a simple but important idea: learning new words in a context faster than learning them without context just from your paper or electronic vocabulary. You can feed him words which you want to remember and it can give your examples of phrases with your words. It gets them from recent tweets, therefore it supports words from almost any language you have wanted to know.
